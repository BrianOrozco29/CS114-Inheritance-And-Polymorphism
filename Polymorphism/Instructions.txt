(b) Polymorphism: (1 point)

Implement the Speaker interface:

public interface Speaker {
public void speak();
public void announce(String  str);
}

Then, create three classes that implement Speaker in various ways: 

•	SpeakerOfTheHouse: speak method  prints "I am Speaker of the House.", and 
the announce method  takes the name  of a bill in the form of a string 
and prints it in the sentence "The [bill] has passed!"
•	SportsAnnouncer: speak method  prints "Goal!", and the announce method 
takes the name  of a team in the form of a string  and prints the sentence
"The [team] have scored a goal!"
•	Actor: speak method  prints "I've been nominated for three Academy 
Awards.", and the announce method  takes the name  of a movie in the form
of a string  and prints the sentence, "I'm currently staring in [movie]."


Create a driver class , and in the main method , prompt the user to enter three
Strings  -- the name  of a bill, the name  of a sports team, and the name  of a movie.
Then, create an object  from each of the classes described above and call the speak 
and announce methods  of each object , using the strings  provided by the user.
